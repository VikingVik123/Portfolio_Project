# AUTOTRADER
Your gateway to stressfree trading

The directory contains everything i've achieved so far. In it's current form Autotrader works on Binance testnet, it fetchs price data, calculates indicator values, generates signals and places trades based on the trading strategy. I'm currently working on a telegram interface which will enable monitoring and control from telegram.

# OPERATION
